## Katahasin developer notes

This repository contains the project source files for my IDP project for sem 1 18/19, done using ionic3, which was sponsored by Felda Mobile. These legacy files have been uploaded for exhibition purposes, the actual project was completed by the end of 2018. Serve in ionic 3 to edit, or export to create app. This is the final version that was used in Felda Mobile and is open source. Its primary purpose was to serve as an ERP system to update the then current paper based budgeting system, allowing staff to dynamically update and requistion supplies and budget for marketing events. This system was also paired with a Python based back end system for higher level staff to monitor the apps db in an user friendly environment (the db was created using firebase).
